This is a basic tic-tac-toe game with move list and dark mode functionalities. Users can click to move buttons to jump to that respective move,
also left and right arrow keys can be used to traverse around the moves. The move list can be toggled to ordered by ascending or descending order.
There is also a checkbox to toggle dark mode on/off.
